/**
 * Write a program to reads a number between 0 and 1000, and adds all the digits in the integer
 * HINT: use the modulud (%) and division opertors. For example, if you take the number 849
 * and do a modulus 10 (849%10), you'll get the last digit 9. Next you try to reduce the number
 * to '84' so that 84%10 will give you the current last digit 4. Hope you got the idea!
